## These are my visible projects, so I will update as commits are made.
### Some of them could have some issues, mistakes or need to be updated, I think is the most common, the good thing is: I have the solution, and if don´t, I will. So, let´s start explaining:
<h1 align="center"><u>Face recognition</u></h1>
<p>This is a program which allows to compare three different images and compare each one to declare if they are the same person or not. It´s done by using Python libraries such as CV2, which allows to work with images.</p>
<h1 align="center"><u>Hanging Tree</u></h1>
<p>The classic and old game which consists about guessing letters to know which word is the program asking. I´ve added a screen to play with to avoid the terminal interaction and output</p>
<h1 align="center"><u>Voice Assistant</u></h1>
<p>It´s said that a machine cannot be a friend, but I say yes, it can. This program interacts with you by asking orders, such as playing music, surfing in the net or even telling jokes. Unfortanetly, currently is in development to improve its knowledge and learning, but is plenty functional right now.</p>
